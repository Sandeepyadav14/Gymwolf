Hold this position briefly and make sure you have complete control of the bar. Now raise the bar up to the starting postion.  Return the bar to the rack after you've completed your set.",
          "tips": "The width of your grip on the bar will change the focus of the bench press. A medium grip is most common. This is slightly wider than shoulder-width apart. It's usually marked on the bar.  Having a spotter to help you with the bench press is essential. A competitive, motivating spotter is one of the most valuable assets you can find.  Choose a weight that is challenging and allows you to maintain proper form. Improper form is less effective and could result in an injury. Use a slow controlled motion and never lock your elbows.",

While holding the bar, start the lift by pushing with your legs while simultaneously getting your torso to the upright position as you breathe out. In the upright position, stick your chest out and contract the back by bringing the shoulder blades back. Think of how the soldiers in the military look when they are in standing in attention. 4. Go back to the starting position by bending at the knees while simultaneously leaning the torso forward at the waist while keeping the back straight.

As you bring it past your knees, don’t think about pulling up with your back, thrust in with your hips. Keep your head up and chest out as you lift - this will help you keep your back aligned properly. As you bring the weight up, you want your legs to straighten out simultaneously as your hips come in completely - form a straight line at the same time with your hips, knees and feet.",

          "steps": "1 Grab the pull-up bar with the palms facing forward using the prescribed grip. Note on grips: For a wide grip, your hands need to be spaced out at a distance wider than your shoulder width. For a medium grip, your hands need to be spaced out at a distance equal to your shoulder width and for a close grip at a distance smaller than your shoulder width.  2. As you have both arms extended in front of you holding the bar at the chosen grip width, bring your torso back around 30 degrees or so while creating a curvature on your lower back and sticking your chest out. This is your starting position.  3. Pull your torso up until the bar touches your upper chest by drawing the shoulders and the upper arms down and back. Exhale as you perform this portion of the movement. Tip: Concentrate on squeezing the back muscles once you reach the full contracted position. The upper torso should remain stationary as it moves through space and only the arms should move. The forearms should do no other work other than hold the bar.  4. After a second on the contracted position, start to inhale and slowly lower your torso back to the starting position when your arms are fully extended and the lats are fully stretched.  5. Repeat this motion for the prescribed amount of repetitions.",
          "tips": "1. If you are new at this exercise and do not have the strength to perform it, use a chin assist machine if available. These machines use weight to help you push your bodyweight. 2. Otherwise, a spotter holding your legs can help. 3. On the other hand, more advanced lifters can add weight to the exercise by using a weight belt that allows the addition of weighted plates. 4. The behind the neck variation is not recommended as it can be hard on the rotator cuff due to the hyperextension created by bringing the bar behind the neck.",

Your hands should be slightly wider than shoulder width apart outside knees with elbows fully extended. Place the bar about 1 inch in front of your shins and over the balls of your feet. Your back should be flat or slightly arched, your chest held up and out and your shoulder blades should be retracted. Keep your head in a neutral position (in line with vertebral column and not tilted or rotated) with your eyes focused straight ahead. Inhale during this phase.  2. First Pull Phase  Lift the bar from the floor by forcefully extending the hips and the knees as you exhale. Tip: The upper torso should maintain the same angle. Do not bend at the waist yet and do not let the hips rise before the shoulders (this would have the effect of pushing the glutes in the air and stretching the hamstrings. Keep elbows fully extended with the head in a neutral position and the shoulders over the bar. As the bar raises keep it as close to the shins as possible.  3. Transition or Scoop Phase  As the bar passes the knees, thrust your hips forward and slightly bend the knees to avoid locking them. Tip: At this point your thighs should be against the bar. Keep the back flat or slightly arched, elbows fully extended and your head neutral. Tip: You will hold your breath until the next phase.  4. Second Pull Phase  Inhale and then forcefully and quickly extend your hips and knees and stand on your toes. Keep the bar as close to your body as possible. Tip: Your back should be flat with the elbows pointed out to the sides and your head in a neutral position. Also, keep your shoulders over the bar and arms straight as long as possible. When your lower body joints are fully extended, shrug the shoulders upward rapidly without letting the elbows flex yet. Exhale during this portion of the movement. As the shoulders reach their highest elevation flex your elbows to begin pulling your body under the bar. Continue to pull the arms as high and as long as possible. Tip: Due to the explosive nature of this phase, your torso will be erect or with an arched back, your head will be tilted back slightly and your feet may lose contact with the floor.  5. Catch Phase  After the lower body has fully extended and the bar reaches near maximal height, pull your body under the bar and rotate the arms around and under the bar. Simultaneously, flex the hips and knees into a quarter squat position. Once the arms are under the bar, inhale and then lift your elbows to position the upper arms parallel to the floor. Rack the bar across the front of your collar bones and front shoulder muscles. Catch the bar with an erect and tight torso, a neutral head position and flat feet. Exhale during this movement. Stand up by extending the hips and knees to a fully erect position.  6. Downward Movement Phase  Lower the bar by gradually reducing the muscular tension of the arms to allow a controlled descent of the bar to the thighs. Inhale during this movement. Simultaneously flex the hips and knees to cushion the impact of the bar on the thighs. Squat down with the elbows fully extended until the bar touches the floor. Start over at Phase 1 and repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.",

          "tips": "It is important to have active shoulders, and a small dip to facilitate the drive of the load upwards. The drop under the bar makes it so the load doesn't have to travel as far to make the catch easier. Note that the dip is not so low as to be a front squat, which takes away the stretch that helps drive the force up enough to pull underneath it during the catch. It is also common to \"jump\" the legs from hip width into a squat stance, where the hips are about shoulder width apart.  According to CrossFit, you can typically lift 30% more weight with the push press than with the shoulder press and 30% more with the push jerk than with the push press.",

Whilst good for beginners the goblet squat is still a great exercise in its own right and worth integrating into your routine. It's a simple and safe squatting movement, challenges a load of muscle in one movement and really gets the heart pumping.  You can perform the goblet squat with dumbbells, sandbags, medicine balls and most other weighted objects too, but the kettlebell is perfectly moulded for the goblet squat because you can hold it around the side handles and keep it nice and contained against the chest.",

Squeeze your shoulder blades together, and push your chest out. 2. Begin pressing the bar overhead retracting your head as the bas rises to keep it out of the way. When the bar passes your head, press it up and slightly backward so that it ends up in line with the back of your head. Hold for a moment, then lower the bar back to your shoulders. That’s one rep.",
          "tips": "Technique is very important in this lift. The tendency is to arch the low back during the upward phase, increasing the loading upon your spine. Use a mirror for feedback, press overhead and not behind your head, and squeeze your abdominal muscles and glutes to help prevent excessive arching. - See more at: http://www.acefitness.org/acefit/fitness_programs_exercise_library_details.aspx?exerciseid=71#sthash.JhSAtYcf.dpuf To get the bar into position, you can either explosively heave it up off the floor and up to your shoulders, or set the bar at shoulder level on the supports of a power rack. If the bar is on the rack, nudge it off and let it rest against the front of your shoulders. Never allow the bar to touch your upper chest when you lower it. If you find that it does, raise your elbows up slightly. This will prevent your delts from stretching too much. Pressing heavy loads requires significant recovery time, so limit the exercise to one workout per week. The first rep is the hardest because the lift starts with no eccentric [lowering] phase and no stretch reflex. After the first rep, the reflex will kick in to help you.",
